                    <h1>I love design.</h1>
                    <p>I’ve been designing things, in some capacity, for over 10 years. Here are some things I have experience with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Graphic Design & Layout</li>
                        <li>Logo & Branding</li>
                        <li>Illustration</li>
                        <li>Web Design</li>
                        <li>Prepress & Production</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>I love code.</h1>
                    <p>I learned HTML, CSS, and Sass on my own. I graduated from a coding boot camp. I’d rather build something in the browser than make a mockup to pass to a developer.</p>

                    <h1>I love GitHub.</h1>
                    <p>I love open source and knowledge sharing; it’s how I got into coding, through tutorials and resources I found on the web. I enjoy being active on GitHub, even if I haven’t fully used it to its fullest potential. At one point I had a 150-day GitHub streak that was a point of pride.</p>

                    <h1>I enjoy writing.</h1>
                    <p>If I hadn’t become a designer, I probably would have pursued writing as a career. A few years ago I participated in National Novel Writing Month, and wrote a 50,000 word novel in 30 days. And while I can’t vouch for its quality, it was a goal of mine that I completed. I also write <a href="http://medium.com/@amacduff" target="_blank">articles on Medium</a> periodically.</p>

                    <h1>I have remote work experience.</h1>
                    <p>For the better part of the past year I worked for a remote company doing UI design. I know what it takes to communicate and collaborate well, and provide adequate written documentation for colleagues. I’m also adept at creating custom Slack emojis.</p>
